How to create a website from beginning to end

1) Create a Github account and git software. Although You don't need to synchronize git and github with R studio but it is better.

2) Create a git repository
               ------------------- Trick is the name of the git repository has to be user name.github.io
			   -------------------Create a readme file and give some description (Not absolutely necessary)
               ------------------ Clone your github website link. 


(3)	Go to the Rstudio and create a project
        ----------------- Paste the url in the git repository link 
        -----------------  Need to create _site.yml and index.Rmd and about.Rmd and .nojekyll file
		-----------------  You can create as many as tab for your Website.
		
(4) Create a text file from Rstudio (below in the Rmarkdown tab )
		------ paste the following command and save it. It creates a _site.yml file in your repository.

name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
      
output:
 html_document:
 theme: cosmo
 highlight: textmate
 
output_dir: "." 		

(5) Create a Rmarkdown file and name it as index.Rmd file and can write anything. I use the default rmarkdown document and save it.

(6) Now Create another Rmarkdown file and name it as about.Rmd file and You can write anything and save it.

(7) Also create a text file same as _site.yml file and save it as .nojekyll name.

(8) Now go to the Rstudio command line and do the following

install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)

rmarkdown::render_site()

Eventually you will see something like                     Output created: index.html

(9) Now go to the Rstudio > Git > More > Shell  and write the following command and hit enter

git add .

git commit -m "first try"


(9) Then go to the Rstudio > Git > push (It will push all the file in the github repository)

(10) Final step and we are done.
--------- Go to the setting > scroll down and you will find the option github pages > do chose master and publish it. 


                                             done.
